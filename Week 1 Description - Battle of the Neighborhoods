Scenario: In order to increase tourism to Vermont, the Vermont Department of Tourism has instructed its data analysts to find gaps in landmark data available on popular location search engines powered by FourSquare. The goal of this project is to fill any those gaps with government sourced landmark information provided to Foursquare in order to increase landmark information awareness, and therefore increase tourism to the state. 
Because the size of the data is so large, I decided to focus on one kind of landmark, cemeteries. I will use landmark data provided by the Vermont.gov website to identify cemeteries located in the Montpelier metropolitan area. Once I've organized this data into a dataframe and plotted it on a folium map, I will examine results provided by Foursquare.
I will search for cemeteries in the Montpelier, VT area using Foursquare and organize the results into a dataframe, and plot the available location data. I'll then compare the two datasets, identify gaps, and offer a solution to present to the Vermont Department of Tourism.
